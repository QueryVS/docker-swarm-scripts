# docker-swarm-scripts

## Purpose

Create and manage services in a docker swarm easily

## Description

This repository contains small scripts which can help you create and manage your docker services in a docker swarm environment.

I used these scripts to fill the gaps that I saw in docker CLI just for myself. They helped me managing my docker swarms on multiple hosts. 

### Usage

I hope script names are descriptive enough, but you should conside having a look at the contents before using them.

Hope they also help you :)

Plesase feel free to customize or improve them and if you wish send me a merge reuqest.
